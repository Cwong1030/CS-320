In the development process, ensuring both functionality and security is paramount. To achieve this, a systematic approach was followed, encompassing thorough testing for functionality validation and the implementation of secure coding practices to address security concerns.

For functionality validation, rigorous testing was conducted using comprehensive JUnit tests specifically designed for the contact classes and services. These tests were meticulously crafted to verify that the contact services met the customer's requirements, including functionalities such as adding, updating, and deleting contact objects. By executing these tests, the functionality of the software was systematically verified, ensuring that it operates as expected.

In tandem with functionality validation, security considerations were integrated into the development process. Secure coding practices were adopted to mitigate common vulnerabilities, such as validating user inputs to prevent malicious exploits. Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms were implemented to control access to contact data, ensuring that only authorized users can modify sensitive information. Additionally, encryption techniques were employed to safeguard confidential data, such as contact details, from unauthorized access.

Effective communication and understanding of user needs played a pivotal role in shaping the development process. Clear requirements provided by the customer were meticulously reviewed and analyzed to gain a comprehensive understanding of their expectations. Any ambiguities or uncertainties were promptly clarified through active communication with the customer, ensuring accurate interpretation and alignment with their needs.

To further incorporate user needs, extensive engagement with the customer was undertaken. This involved conducting user interviews and workshops to gather insights into their preferences, pain points, and expectations. Creating detailed user personas and documenting use cases and user stories facilitated the prioritization of features and functionalities based on user requirements, ensuring that the software effectively addresses their specific needs.

The design of the software was approached methodically, with a focus on code organization, modularity, and reusability. The requirements were systematically broken down into smaller components, leading to the design and implementation of the contact object class and contact service class. Unit tests were instrumental in validating the functionality of the contact service, ensuring that it operates reliably under different scenarios. Adherence to best practices for code documentation and readability further enhanced collaboration and maintainability, facilitating future development and updates.
