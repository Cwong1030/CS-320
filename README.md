When developing code, programs, or software, ensuring both functionality and security is crucial. To achieve this, several steps can be followed. Firstly, thorough testing is essential to ensure the functionality of the software. In the case of the contact classes and services, the unit tests were written to verify that the contact services met the customer's requirements. By designing and executing comprehensive JUnit tests, I validated that the contact service successfully adds, updates, and deletes contact objects as expected.

To address security concerns, it's important to implement secure coding practices. This involves validating user inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities. Additionally, implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms is crucial to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify contacts. Encryption techniques should be employed, where necessary, to protect sensitive data such as contact information. Regularly updating and patching libraries and frameworks used in the codebase is also essential to address known security vulnerabilities and ensure a secure software environment.

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program requires effective communication and understanding. In the case of this section, the customer provided me with the requirements for this part of the mobile application. I carefully reviewed and analyzed the requirements to gain a clear understanding of what the customer expects. If any aspects are unclear or ambiguous, seeking clarification from the customer would be essential to ensure accurate interpretation.

To incorporate user needs effectively, engaging in active communication with the customer would be crucial. This can involve conducting user interviews or workshops to gather insights into their motivations, pain points, and ideas. Creating user personas that represent different user types can also aid in understanding their characteristics, goals, and challenges. By documenting use cases and user stories, you can prioritize features and functionality based on user requirements, ensuring that the program caters to their specific needs.

Approaching the design of software involved a systematic approach. For the development of the contact classes I began to break down the requirements into smaller components. Designing the contact object class and the contact service class was the next step. Paying attention to code organization, modularity, and reusability to ensure that the software is maintainable and scalable. Writing unit tests being vital to validating the functionalities of the contact service and finally, following the best practices for code documentation and readability were essential to enhance collaboration and maintainability.
